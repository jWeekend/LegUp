Leg Up
============================

Do you need a leg up?

This project provides skeleton applications which integrate [Apache Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/) with other software technologies like [Spring](http://www.springsource.org/spring-framework), [Google Guice](https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/), [GuicePersist](https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/GuicePersist), [JPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API) (with one or more implementation from EclipseLink, Hibernate, OpenJPA). The projects you will generate will include enough configuration, code and/or some tests to get you started, quickly.
